# ðŸš€ Deploy to GCP Now - 3 Simple Steps

I've created an automated deployment system for you. Here's all you need to do:

## Prerequisites (One-time setup)

```bash
# 1. Install Google Cloud CLI (if not already installed)
# Mac:
brew install google-cloud-sdk

# Other OS:
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Authenticate with Google Cloud

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

_This opens your browser - just click "Allow"_

### Step 2: Get Your Virtuoso API Token

1. Go to https://app.virtuoso.qa
2. Navigate to Settings > API
3. Click "Generate API Token"
4. Copy the token

### Step 3: Run the Deployment

```bash
cd gcp
./one-click-deploy.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will:

- âœ… Auto-detect or create a GCP project
- âœ… Enable all required APIs
- âœ… Build and deploy your API
- âœ… Set up all cloud services
- âœ… Configure monitoring
- âœ… Run tests
- âœ… Give you the API URL

## ðŸ“‹ What Happens During Deployment

```
ðŸš€ Virtuoso API GCP Deployment
==============================
âœ“ Checking prerequisites...
âœ“ Authenticating with GCP...
âœ“ Creating/selecting project...
âœ“ Enabling APIs...
âœ“ Building container...
âœ“ Creating secrets...
âœ“ Deploying to Cloud Run...
âœ“ Setting up Firestore...
âœ“ Configuring monitoring...
âœ“ Running tests...

âœ… Deployment Complete!

Your API is live at:
https://virtuoso-api-abc123-uc.a.run.app

Test commands:
curl https://virtuoso-api-abc123-uc.a.run.app/health
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-key" https://virtuoso-api-abc123-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/commands

View logs:
gcloud run logs read --service=virtuoso-api

Monitor:
https://console.cloud.google.com/run
```

## ðŸ”‘ Generated Credentials

The deployment automatically:

- Creates 3 API keys for your clients
- Stores them in Secret Manager
- Shows them in the deployment report
- Saves them to `deployment-report.txt`

## ðŸ’° Cost

- **While idle**: $0.00/month
- **Active usage**: ~$0.50 per million requests
- **Free tier**: First 2M requests/month free
- **Estimated monthly**: $0-50 for most use cases

## ðŸ†˜ If Something Goes Wrong

The script handles most errors automatically, but if needed:

```bash
# Check what went wrong
cat deployment-report.txt

# View detailed logs
gcloud run logs read --service=virtuoso-api --limit=50

# Rollback if needed
./rollback.sh

# Get help
echo "Error details:" && gcloud run services describe virtuoso-api
```

## ðŸ“Š After Deployment

1. **Test your API**:

   ```bash
   # Use the URL from deployment output
   curl https://your-api-url.run.app/health
   ```

2. **View API docs**:

   ```
   https://your-api-url.run.app/docs
   ```

3. **Monitor usage**:
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/run
   ```

## ðŸŽ‰ That's It!

Your Virtuoso API is now:

- âœ… Live on Google Cloud
- âœ… Auto-scaling from 0 to millions
- âœ… Secured with API keys
- âœ… Monitored 24/7
- âœ… Costing $0 when idle

**Total time**: ~15 minutes
**Your effort**: 3 simple steps
**Result**: Production-ready API
