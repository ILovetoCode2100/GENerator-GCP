```

### ✅ Branch Management

**Branch**: `optimized-ai`
- Created from main with all optimizations
- 8 commits documenting the optimization journey
- Clean history with meaningful commit messages

**Key Commits**:
1. Initial optimization - documentation consolidation
2. AI integration enhancement - output formats and guides
3. Test refinement - templates and examples
4. Final polish - validation and cleanup

## AI Optimization Benefits

### 1. **Minimal Context Window**
- 32 KB total for complete understanding
- Single README contains all documentation
- Templates abstract complex operations

### 2. **Structured Test Generation**
```yaml
journey:
  checkpoints:
    - steps:
        - command: navigate to
          args: ["url"]
```

### 3. **Intelligent Assistance**
```json
{
  "next_steps": [
    "wait element '.loading'",
    "assert exists '.content'"
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Validation Before Execution**
- Templates checked for structure
- Commands verified for syntax
- Reduces error cycles
