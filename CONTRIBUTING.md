# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-cli-generator.git
cd api-cli-generator

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/api-cli-generator.git

# Install dependencies

## Coding Guidelines

### Go Code Style

- Follow the official [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Use `golint` and `go vet` to check for common issues
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

Example test structure:

```go
func TestFunctionName(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:  "valid input",
            input: "test",
            want:  "TEST",
        },
        {
            name:    "empty input",
            input:   "",
            wantErr: true,
        },
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := FunctionName(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("FunctionName() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
                return
            }
            if got != tt.want {
                t.Errorf("FunctionName() = %v, want %v", got, tt.want)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```
Add support for batch operations

- Implement create-structure command
- Add YAML/JSON parsing for structure files
- Include validation for structure format
- Add comprehensive tests

Fixes #123
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add or update command documentation in COMMANDS.md
- Include code comments for complex logic
- Add examples for new features
