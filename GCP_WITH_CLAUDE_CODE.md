## 💰 Cost Breakdown with GCP

### Free Tier (Perfect for starting)

- **Total**: $0/month

### Small Scale (< 10k users)

- **Cloud Run**: ~$5-10/month
- **Memorystore Redis**: $35/month
- **Total**: $40-45/month

### Medium Scale (10k-100k users)

- **Cloud Run**: ~$20-50/month
- **Memorystore Redis**: $50/month
- **Total**: $70-100/month
