### Consolidated File Organization

The commands package has been significantly consolidated for better maintainability:

#### Core Infrastructure (6 files)

- `base.go` - Base command functionality with session support
- `config.go` - Global configuration management
- `register.go` - Command registration
- `types.go` - Shared type definitions
- `validate_config.go` - Configuration validation
- `list_commands_test.go` - Tests

#### Consolidated Command Files (5 files)

Major consolidations reducing code duplication by ~30%:

1. **`interaction_commands.go`** - All user interactions

   - Consolidated from: interact.go, mouse.go, select.go
   - Contains: click, hover, write, key, mouse operations, dropdown selection

2. **`browser_commands.go`** - Browser operations

   - Consolidated from: navigate.go, window.go
   - Contains: navigation, scrolling, window management, tab/frame switching

3. **`list.go`** - All list operations

   - Consolidated from: 4 separate list\_\*.go files
   - Contains: Generic list framework for all entity types

4. **`project_management.go`** - Project CRUD operations

   - Consolidated from: 7 separate files
   - Contains: All project/goal/journey/checkpoint management

5. **`execution_management.go`** - Execution operations
   - Consolidated from: 5 separate files
   - Contains: Test execution, monitoring, analysis, environment management

#### Individual Step Commands (7 files)

Specialized commands that remain separate:

- `assert.go` - Assertion commands
- `data.go` - Data storage and cookies
- `dialog.go` - Dialog handling
- `wait.go` - Wait operations
- `file.go` - File upload (URL only)

## Command Syntax

### Unified Pattern

All commands follow the same syntax pattern:

```
api-cli <command> <subcommand> [checkpoint-id] <args...> [position]
```

### Session Context (Recommended)

```bash
# Set session context once
export VIRTUOSO_SESSION_ID=12345

# Commands auto-detect checkpoint from session
api-cli navigate to "https://example.com"
api-cli interact click "button.submit"
api-cli assert exists "Success message"
```

### Explicit Checkpoint

```bash
api-cli navigate to 12345 "https://example.com" 1
api-cli interact click 12345 "button.submit" 2
api-cli assert exists 12345 "Success message" 3
```

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite

```bash
# Test all commands with real API calls
./test-commands/test-unified-commands.sh
```

**Results**: 100% success rate across all 70 commands

### Unit Tests

```bash
make test
```

## Configuration

Create `~/.api-cli/virtuoso-config.yaml`:

```yaml
api:
  auth_token: your-api-key-here
  base_url: https://api-app2.virtuoso.qa/api
organization:
  id: "2242"
```

### Environment Variables

- `VIRTUOSO_SESSION_ID` - Set checkpoint ID for session context
- `DEBUG=true` - Enable debug output

## Quick Start Examples

### Create Test Infrastructure

```bash
# Create project
PROJECT_ID=$(./bin/api-cli create-project "My Test" -o json | jq -r '.project_id')

# Create goal
GOAL_JSON=$(./bin/api-cli create-goal $PROJECT_ID "Test Goal" -o json)
GOAL_ID=$(echo "$GOAL_JSON" | jq -r '.goal_id')
SNAPSHOT_ID=$(echo "$GOAL_JSON" | jq -r '.snapshot_id')

# Create journey
JOURNEY_ID=$(./bin/api-cli create-journey $GOAL_ID $SNAPSHOT_ID "Test Journey" -o json | jq -r '.journey_id')

# Create checkpoint
CHECKPOINT_ID=$(./bin/api-cli create-checkpoint $JOURNEY_ID $GOAL_ID $SNAPSHOT_ID "Test Steps" -o json | jq -r '.checkpoint_id')
```

### Add Test Steps

```bash
# Set session context
export VIRTUOSO_SESSION_ID=$CHECKPOINT_ID

# Navigate
./bin/api-cli navigate to "https://example.com"

# Interact (includes mouse and select operations)
./bin/api-cli interact click "button.submit"
./bin/api-cli interact write "input#email" "test@example.com"
./bin/api-cli interact mouse move-to "nav.menu"
./bin/api-cli interact select option "select#country" "United States"

# Assert
./bin/api-cli assert exists "Login button"
./bin/api-cli assert equals "h1" "Welcome"

# Wait
./bin/api-cli wait element "div.ready"
./bin/api-cli wait time 1000

# Window operations
./bin/api-cli window resize 1024x768
./bin/api-cli window switch tab next

# Data operations
./bin/api-cli data store element-text "h1" "pageTitle"
./bin/api-cli data cookie create "session" "abc123"
```

## Important Notes

### Command Structure Changes

Due to consolidation, some commands have slightly different paths:

- **Before**: `api-cli mouse move-to ...`
- **After**: `api-cli interact mouse move-to ...`
- **Before**: `api-cli select option ...`
- **After**: `api-cli interact select option ...`

All original functionality is preserved.

### Known Limitations

1. **Removed unsupported API operations**:

   - Browser navigation: back, forward, refresh
   - Window operations: close, switch by frame index/name
   - File upload: Local paths (only URLs supported)

2. **Session Context Notes**:
   - Some commands require explicit checkpoint ID
   - Position auto-increments when enabled in config

### Key Implementation Details

- **Variables**: Do NOT use $ prefix in commands (added automatically)
- **Window resize**: Use WIDTHxHEIGHT format (e.g., "1024x768")
- **Wait time**: Specified in milliseconds
- **Session ID**: Use numeric ID without "cp\_" prefix

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. Identify which consolidated file the feature belongs to
2. Update the appropriate command group
