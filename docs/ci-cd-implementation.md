# CI/CD Implementation Documentation

This document captures the complete CI/CD implementation created for the Virtuoso API CLI Generator project.

## Overview

The CI/CD implementation includes:
- GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and quality checks
- GoReleaser configuration for multi-platform releases
- Dependabot for automated dependency updates
- Comprehensive linting and code quality enforcement
- Docker multi-architecture builds
- Homebrew formula generation

## Files Created

### 1. Main CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Primary CI pipeline for testing, building, and releasing
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop branches, pull requests, manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Go matrix testing (1.21, 1.22)
  - Linting with golangci-lint
  - Security scanning with gosec
  - OpenAPI spec validation
  - Docker builds for amd64/arm64
  - Automated releases on tags

### 2. Code Quality Workflow (`.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Dedicated code quality checks
- **Tools**: staticcheck, gocyclo, misspell, gofmt, ineffassign, unparam
- **Coverage**: Test coverage reporting to Codecov

### 3. Security Workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Security scanning and vulnerability detection
- **Tools**: gosec, govulncheck, nancy (dependency scanning)
- **Features**: SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab

### 4. Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Automated releases using GoReleaser
- **Triggers**: Git tags (v*.*.*)
- **Outputs**: Multi-platform binaries, Docker images, Homebrew formula

### 5. Dependency Management (`.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Automated dependency updates and security checks
- **Schedule**: Weekly on Mondays
- **Features**: Go module updates, security vulnerability checks

## Configuration Files

### GoReleaser (`.goreleaser.yml`)
```yaml
# Multi-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
# ARM64 and AMD64 architectures
# Docker multi-arch images
# Homebrew formula generation
# Automated changelog generation
```

### Linting Configuration (`.golangci.yml`)
```yaml
# 28+ enabled linters
# Generated code exclusions (src/api/)
# Custom rules for test files
# Performance and style checks
```

### Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
```yaml
# Weekly updates for Go modules
# GitHub Actions updates
# Docker base image updates
# Automated PR creation
```

## Make Targets

The implementation leverages existing Makefile targets:
- `make ci` - Run complete CI pipeline locally
- `make lint` - Run linting checks
- `make test` - Run test suite
- `make coverage` - Generate coverage reports
- `make tools` - Install development tools
- `make release-snapshot` - Test release process

## Key Features

### 1. Quality Gates
- All PRs must pass linting, tests, and security checks
- Code coverage reporting
- Automated formatting validation
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### 2. Multi-Platform Support
- Binaries for Linux, macOS, Windows (AMD64/ARM64)
- Docker images for both architectures
- Universal binaries for macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)

### 3. Security
- Static analysis with gosec
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- SARIF reporting to GitHub Security
- Automated security updates via Dependabot

### 4. Release Automation
- Semantic versioning with git tags
- Automated changelog generation
- Multi-platform binary releases
- Docker image publishing
- Homebrew formula updates

### 5. Developer Experience
- Local CI simulation with `make ci`
- Comprehensive tooling installation
- Clear feedback on quality issues
- Automated dependency management

## Usage

### Running CI Locally
```bash
make ci
```

### Creating a Release
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Installing Development Tools
```bash
make tools
```

### Testing Release Process
```bash
make release-snapshot
```

## Benefits

1. **Automated Quality**: Every change is automatically tested and validated
2. **Security**: Continuous security scanning and dependency updates
3. **Reliability**: Multi-platform testing ensures broad compatibility
4. **Efficiency**: Automated releases reduce manual work
5. **Maintainability**: Dependabot keeps dependencies current
6. **Visibility**: Clear feedback on code quality and security issues

## Project Integration

This CI/CD implementation is designed to work with the existing project structure:
- Respects generated code in `src/api/`
- Integrates with existing Makefile targets
- Uses project-specific configuration
- Maintains backward compatibility with current workflows

The implementation can be merged immediately and will provide comprehensive automation for the Virtuoso API CLI Generator project.
