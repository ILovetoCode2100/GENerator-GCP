# Virtuoso API CLI - Comprehensive Test Results Summary

## Overview

After analyzing previous test logs and fixing command syntax based on successful examples, we achieved a **90% success rate** (50 out of 55 commands working).

## Test Results

### ✅ **Fully Working Command Groups**

1. **Assert Commands** (12/12) - 100% working

   - All assertion types working correctly
   - Fixed `assert selected` by providing position parameter

2. **Interact Commands** (6/6) - 100% working

   - All interaction commands functioning properly

3. **Data Commands** (5/5) - 100% working

   - Fixed syntax: `data store element-text` instead of `data store-text`
   - Fixed syntax: `data cookie clear-all` instead of `data cookie-clear`

4. **Dialog Commands** (5/5) - 100% working

   - Fixed syntax: `dialog dismiss alert` instead of `dialog dismiss-alert`
   - Proper flag usage with `--accept` and `--reject`

5. **Wait Commands** (2/2) - 100% working

   - Both element and time waits functioning

6. **Window Commands** (5/5) - 100% working

   - Fixed syntax: `window resize 1024x768` (WIDTHxHEIGHT format)
   - Fixed syntax: `window switch tab` instead of `window switch-tab`

7. **Select Commands** (2/2) - 100% working

   - Index and last selection working

8. **Misc Commands** (2/2) - 100% working

   - Comment and execute JavaScript working

9. **Output Formats** (3/3) - 100% working
   - JSON, YAML, and AI formats all functioning

### ⚠️ **Partially Working Command Groups**

1. **Navigate Commands** (1/3) - 33% working

   - ✅ `navigate to` - Working
   - ❌ `navigate scroll-top` - Panic (index out of range)
   - ❌ `navigate scroll-bottom` - Panic (index out of range)

2. **Mouse Commands** (5/6) - 83% working

   - ✅ All commands except move-by
   - ❌ `mouse move-by` - Flag parsing error with negative numbers

3. **File Commands** (0/1) - 0% working

   - ❌ `file upload` - Parameter order issue

4. **Library Commands** (2/3) - 67% working
   - ✅ `library get` and `library attach` - Working
   - ❌ `library add` - Checkpoint not found

## Key Syntax Fixes Applied

### 1. **Nested Subcommand Structure**

```bash
# Fixed
data store element-text 'selector' 'variable'
dialog dismiss alert
window switch tab next

# Previously failing
data store-text 'selector' 'variable'
dialog dismiss-alert
window switch-tab next
```

### 2. **Format Requirements**

```bash
# Fixed
window resize 1024x768  # WIDTHxHEIGHT format

# Previously failing
window resize 1280 720  # Space-separated
```

### 3. **Parameter Order**

```bash
# Correct
file upload 'https://example.com/file.pdf' '#selector'

# Wrong (what I had in test)
file upload '#selector' 'https://example.com/file.pdf'
```

## Remaining Issues

1. **Navigate scroll commands** - Implementation has bug with position handling
2. **Mouse move-by with negative numbers** - CLI interprets `-30` as a flag
3. **File upload** - Expects file path to be a valid file, not selector
4. **Library add** - May need valid checkpoint ID from current test session

## Recommendations

1. **For navigate scroll issues**: The panic suggests a bug in `base.go:85` when handling commands without explicit position
2. **For mouse move-by**: May need to use `--` to separate flags from arguments: `mouse move-by -- 50 -30`
3. **For file upload**: Check if command expects local file path or URL
4. **For library add**: Use a checkpoint ID created in the current session

## Success Metrics

- **Total Commands Tested**: 55
- **Successful**: 50
- **Failed**: 5
- **Success Rate**: 90%

This represents a significant improvement from the initial test where many commands were failing due to incorrect syntax. The analysis of previous test logs was instrumental in identifying the correct command patterns.
