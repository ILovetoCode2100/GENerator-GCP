# 🚀 Deploying Virtuoso API CLI to Render

## Overview

Yes! The entire Virtuoso API CLI system can be deployed to Render. I've created a complete Render deployment configuration that includes:

- ✅ FastAPI web service with auto-scaling
- ✅ Redis for caching and rate limiting
- ✅ Background workers (optional)
- ✅ Scheduled cleanup jobs
- ✅ PostgreSQL database (optional, for future features)
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments
- ✅ Built-in monitoring and health checks

## 📋 Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Prerequisites

- Render account (free tier works!)
- GitHub repository with your code
- Virtuoso API credentials

### 2. Deploy with One Click

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

Or deploy manually:

### 3. Manual Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo>
cd virtuoso-GENerator

# Install Render CLI (optional but recommended)
brew install render

# Deploy using the script
cd deployment/render
./deploy.sh
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

In the Render Dashboard, set these environment variables:

```bash
# Required
VIRTUOSO_API_TOKEN=your-virtuoso-api-key
API_KEYS=["your-generated-api-key-1", "your-generated-api-key-2"]

# Optional (have defaults)
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

## 🏗️ What Gets Deployed

### Services Created

1. **Web Service** (`virtuoso-api`)

   - FastAPI application
   - Auto-scaling (1-5 instances)
   - Health checks enabled
   - Custom domain support

2. **Redis** (`virtuoso-redis`)

   - Private service (internal only)
   - Used for rate limiting and caching
   - Automatic persistence

3. **Background Worker** (optional)

   - For async command execution
   - Long-running test suites

4. **Cron Jobs** (optional)
   - Daily cleanup tasks
   - Health monitoring

## 💰 Cost Estimation

### Free Tier (Good for Testing)

- 1 Web Service (512MB RAM)
- 1 Redis instance
- Perfect for development/testing

### Starter Plan (~$25/month)

- Multiple instances with auto-scaling
- Standard Redis
- Custom domain with SSL
- Good for small teams

### Professional (~$85/month)

- High-performance instances
- Pro Redis with more memory
- Zero-downtime deploys
- Production workloads

## 🎯 Key Features on Render

### Auto-Scaling

```yaml
scaling:
  minInstances: 1
  maxInstances: 5
  targetMemoryPercent: 80
  targetCPUPercent: 70
```

### Health Checks

- Automatic health monitoring
- Restart unhealthy instances
- Zero-downtime deployments

### Environment Groups

- Share configuration across services
- Manage secrets securely
- Environment-specific settings

## 📊 Monitoring

### Built-in Render Features

- Real-time logs
- Metrics dashboard
- Deploy notifications
- Uptime monitoring

### API Endpoints

- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/health?detailed=true` - Detailed status
- `/health/metrics` - Prometheus metrics

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### `render.yaml`

Infrastructure as Code - defines all services, scaling, and configuration

### `Dockerfile.render`

Optimized container that includes both CLI and API

### Deployment Scripts

- `deploy.sh` - Automated deployment
- `health-check.sh` - Verify deployment

## 🚦 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Set Custom Domain**

   ```
   Render Dashboard > Settings > Custom Domain
   Add: api.yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Enable Auto-Deploy**

   ```
   Render Dashboard > Settings > Auto-Deploy
   Connect GitHub > Select Branch
   ```

3. **Monitor Performance**

   ```bash
   # Check health
   curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health

   # View metrics
   curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health/metrics
   ```

4. **Test the API**
   ```bash
   # With your API key
   curl -X GET https://your-app.onrender.com/api/v1/commands \
     -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
   ```

## 🆚 Render vs Kubernetes

### Advantages of Render

- ✅ Much simpler deployment
- ✅ Automatic SSL certificates
- ✅ Built-in auto-scaling
- ✅ Managed Redis
- ✅ Zero-config deployments
- ✅ Great developer experience

### When to Use Kubernetes

- Need multi-region deployment
- Complex networking requirements
- Custom scaling policies
- On-premise requirements
