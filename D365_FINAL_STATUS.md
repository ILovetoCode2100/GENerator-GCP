# D365 Virtuoso Deployment - FINAL STATUS REPORT

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED: Goals Were Always There!

### The Problem

- CLI had a bug: it expected goals in an `items` array
- API returns goals in a `map` object with IDs as keys
- Goals existed but weren't visible due to parsing error

### Current Status

**Project 9369: D365 Test Automation Suite**

**Goals Successfully Created:**

1. Sales (ID: 14137)
2. Customer Service (ID: 14138)
3. Field Service (ID: 14139)
4. Marketing (ID: 14140)
5. Finance Operations (ID: 14141)
6. Project Operations (ID: 14142)
7. Human Resources (ID: 14143)
8. Supply Chain (ID: 14144)
9. Commerce (ID: 14145)
10. Test Goal (ID: 14146)
11. Sample D365 Test - Goal (ID: 14147)

**Snapshot ID:** 44270 (shared across all goals)

### What Happened During Initial Deployment

The original deployment script failed because:

1. Used `--project-name` flag which tries to create NEW project each time
2. Since project already existed, all 169 deployments failed
3. Script incorrectly reported success due to missing error checking

**Result:** Project and goals exist, but NO tests were actually deployed

### Next Steps to Complete Deployment

1. **Remove** the `--project-name` flag from deployment
2. **Add** proper goal and project fields to YAML files
3. **Deploy** tests to their respective goals

### Deployment Commands Needed

For each test YAML file:

1. Add these fields at the top:

   ```yaml
   project: 9369
   goal: <appropriate-goal-id>
   ```

2. Deploy without --project-name:
   ```bash
   ./bin/api-cli run-test <yaml-file>
   ```

### Goal ID Mapping

| Module             | Goal ID |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| Sales              | 14137   |
| Customer Service   | 14138   |
| Field Service      | 14139   |
| Marketing          | 14140   |
| Finance Operations | 14141   |
| Project Operations | 14142   |
| Human Resources    | 14143   |
| Supply Chain       | 14144   |
| Commerce           | 14145   |

### Manual Steps Still Required

1. **Update D365 test credentials** in Virtuoso
2. **Configure execution schedules**
3. **Set up notifications**
4. **Verify D365 instance access**

### Summary

- ‚úÖ Project exists
- ‚úÖ All 9 module goals exist
- ‚ùå No tests deployed yet (all 169 failed)
- ‚úÖ CLI bug fixed (goals now visible)
- üîÑ Ready to deploy tests with correct configuration
