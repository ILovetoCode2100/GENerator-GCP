### Key Improvements from Selenium Version

1. **Natural Language Selectors**: Instead of complex XPath/CSS selectors, we use simple hint text like "Add to Bag", "Shopping Bag", etc.
2. **Simplified Structure**: No need for WebDriver setup, browser management, or complex selector fallback logic
3. **AI-Friendly**: Virtuoso's AI will automatically find the correct elements based on the hint text
4. **Maintainable**: When UI changes, tests are more likely to continue working as they rely on meaningful text rather than brittle selectors

### Test Execution

To run the test in Virtuoso:

1. Log into Virtuoso platform
2. Navigate to Project "Rocketshop Test - January 2025"
3. Execute the goal "Complete Purchase Flow"

Or use the CLI (once the API type issue is resolved):

```bash
./bin/api-cli execute-goal 14112
```

### Original Selenium Selectors Replaced

The conversion replaced complex selectors like:

- `By.xpath("/html/body/div/div/div[2]/div[3]/div[2]/div/div[2]/div[2]/button")`
- `By.cssSelector(".flex-stretch > .flex > :nth-child(1) > .focus\\:border-rocket-orange")`

With simple hint text:

- "Add to Bag"
- "Full name"

This makes the test more readable, maintainable, and resilient to UI changes.
