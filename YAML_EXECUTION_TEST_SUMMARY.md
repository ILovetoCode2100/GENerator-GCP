# YAML Execution Test Summary

## Test Date: July 24, 2025

## Executive Summary

Testing of YAML file execution using the Virtuoso API CLI revealed that while the YAML parsing and command generation works correctly, there are significant issues with the execution layer that prevent successful test runs.

## Test Approach

1. **Compact Format Files** - Tested using `./bin/api-cli yaml run <file>`
2. **Simplified Format Files** - Tested using `./bin/api-cli run-test <file>`

## Key Findings

### 1. YAML Parsing Works Correctly

Both command types successfully parse YAML files and generate appropriate CLI commands:

- **Compact format**: Correctly converts shorthand syntax (c:, t:, nav:, etc.) to full commands
- **Simplified format**: Creates test infrastructure (project, goal, journey, checkpoint)

### 2. Execution Issues

#### Compact Format (`yaml run`)

- **Issue**: Creates dynamic checkpoint IDs (e.g., cp_1753339083957415000) that don't exist in the API
- **Error**: "Checkpoint not found" (404 error)
- **Root Cause**: The yaml runner appears to generate temporary checkpoint IDs rather than using existing ones

#### Simplified Format (`run-test`)

- **Issue 1**: Step parsing errors - "write requires object with selector and text"
- **Issue 2**: When steps are simplified, API returns "Invalid test step command" (error 2605)
- **Root Cause**: Mismatch between the expected step format and what the API accepts

### 3. Direct Commands Work

When using direct CLI commands with session context, everything works correctly:

```bash
export VIRTUOSO_SESSION_ID=1682383
./bin/api-cli step-navigate to "https://example.com"  # ✓ Success
```

## Test Results

### Files Tested

1. **newsletter.yaml** (Compact format)

   - Status: ❌ Failed - Checkpoint not found
   - Commands generated correctly

2. **registration-simple-demo.yaml** (Compact format)

   - Status: ❌ Failed - Checkpoint not found + unrecognized action
   - Commands generated correctly

3. **minimal-test.yaml** (Simplified format)

   - Status: ❌ Failed - Step parsing errors
   - Infrastructure created successfully

4. **simple-login-test.yaml** (Simplified format)
   - Status: ❌ Failed - Project already exists
   - When retried with unique name: Step parsing errors

## Error Analysis

### Common Errors

1. **404 Checkpoint Not Found**

   - Occurs with all compact format files
   - The YAML runner creates ephemeral checkpoint IDs

2. **400 Bad Request - Invalid test step command**

   - Occurs when simplified format successfully parses
   - API rejects the generated commands

3. **Step Parsing Errors**
   - "write requires object with selector and text"
   - Indicates format mismatch in the run-test parser

## Recommendations

1. **For Compact Format (`yaml run`)**:

   - The command needs to support using existing checkpoint IDs
   - Should respect VIRTUOSO_SESSION_ID environment variable
   - Alternative: Add checkpoint field support in YAML files

2. **For Simplified Format (`run-test`)**:

   - Fix step parser to generate correct API-compatible commands
   - Update documentation with working examples
   - Add validation before API calls

3. **Workaround**:
   - Use `yaml compile` to generate commands
   - Execute commands individually using direct CLI calls
   - This approach works but defeats the purpose of batch execution

## Configuration Used

```yaml
api:
  auth_token: [VALID]
  base_url: https://api-app2.virtuoso.qa/api
organization:
  id: "2242"
session:
  current_checkpoint_id: 1682383
```

## Conclusion

While the YAML parsing and command generation layer works well, the execution layer has critical issues that prevent practical use of these features. The YAML files themselves are valid and well-structured, but the integration between the YAML runner and the Virtuoso API needs fixes to be functional.

### Next Steps

1. Fix checkpoint ID handling in yaml run command
2. Update step format generation in run-test command
3. Add integration tests for YAML execution
4. Update documentation with working examples once fixed
