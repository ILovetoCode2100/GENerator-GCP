# Rocketshop Selenium Test Migration Summary

## Test Conversion

Successfully converted Selenium Java test to Virtuoso YAML format:

- **File**: `rocketshop-selenium-conversion.yaml`
- **Test Flow**: E-commerce purchase flow (add to cart → checkout → payment → confirmation)

## Deployment Details

Created new Virtuoso infrastructure:

- **Project ID**: 9408 ("Rocketshop Selenium Migration")
- **Goal ID**: 14580 ("E-commerce Purchase Flow")
- **Journey ID**: 611006 ("Complete Purchase Test")
- **Checkpoint ID**: 1683907 ("Rocketshop Purchase Flow")

## Steps Created

Successfully added the following test steps:

1. Navigate to https://rocketshop.virtuoso.qa
2. Assert "Border Not Found" text exists
3. Click "Add to Bag"
4. Click "Shopping Bag"
5. Assert "Shopping Bag" heading exists
6. Click "Go to Checkout"
7. Fill checkout form fields (name, email, address, phone)
8. Fill payment fields (card number)
9. Click "Confirm and Pay"
10. Assert "Purchase Confirmed!" message
11. Click "Download Confirmation"

## Known Issues

- Wait steps couldn't be added due to CLI syntax limitations
- Some form field writes (ZIP code, CVV) encountered errors
- Goal execution failed due to API data type mismatch

## Next Steps

To complete and run the test:

1. Use the Virtuoso web interface to add/fix missing steps
2. Add wait steps where needed (especially before "Add to Bag" click)
3. Complete the CVV field write step
4. Execute the test from the Virtuoso platform

## Alternative Approach

You can also use the simplified YAML test runner:

```bash
./bin/api-cli run-test rocketshop-selenium-conversion.yaml
```

This will create a fresh project and run all steps automatically.
