# Test Suite Summary

## Overview

This test suite comprehensively documents and tests all 69 commands available in the Virtuoso API CLI, demonstrating both the simplified `run-test` syntax and the full direct CLI command syntax.

## Key Findings

### Simplified run-test Syntax Support

The `run-test` command successfully parses and converts these simplified commands:

#### ✅ Fully Supported (12 commands)

1. **navigate** - URL navigation
2. **click** - Click elements
3. **hover** - Hover over elements
4. **write** - Type text with selector/text structure
5. **key** - Press keyboard keys
6. **select** - Select dropdown option (with selector/option structure)
7. **assert** - Basic exists assertion (text or element)
8. **wait** - Time (ms) or element selector
9. **store** - Element text storage with selector/as structure
10. **comment** - Test comments
11. **execute** - JavaScript execution
12. **scroll** - Basic element selector only (not position-based)

#### ❌ Not Supported in Simplified Syntax (57 commands)

- Advanced assertions (not-exists, equals, not-equals, checked, selected, variable, gt, gte, lt, lte, matches)
- Advanced interactions (double-click, right-click)
- Mouse operations (move-to, move-by, move, down, up, enter)
- Select variations (by index, last)
- Advanced scroll (to position, by amount, up/down)
- Window management (resize, maximize, switch tab/iframe/parent-frame)
- Dialog handling (dismiss-alert, dismiss-confirm, dismiss-prompt)
- Cookie operations (create, delete, clear)
- File uploads
- Data storage variations (element-value, attribute with specific attribute name)

### Direct CLI Commands

All 69 commands remain fully functional when used directly with the CLI:

```bash
# Examples of direct usage
api-cli step-assert equals "h1" "Welcome"
api-cli step-interact mouse move-to "button"
api-cli step-window resize 1024x768
api-cli step-dialog dismiss-alert
api-cli step-data cookie create "session" "abc123"
```

## Test Files Created

1. **01-assert-commands.yaml** - Documents all 12 assert variations
2. **02-interact-commands.yaml** - Documents all 15 interact variations
3. **03-navigate-data-commands.yaml** - Tests navigation and data commands
4. **04-window-dialog-misc.yaml** - Tests window, dialog, and misc commands
5. **05-comprehensive-test.yaml** - Full test using all supported commands
6. **06-all-step-commands-direct.yaml** - Reference for all 69 commands
7. **07-simple-working-test.yaml** - Simple test that works with the API

## Recommendations

1. **For Simple Tests**: Use the `run-test` command with its simplified syntax
2. **For Advanced Tests**: Use direct CLI commands with checkpoint IDs
3. **For Production**: Consider creating a wrapper that supports the full command set in YAML

## Usage Examples

### Create a Simple Test

```bash
./bin/api-cli run-test test-all-commands/07-simple-working-test.yaml
```

### Preview Without Creating

```bash
./bin/api-cli run-test test-all-commands/07-simple-working-test.yaml --dry-run
```

### Get JSON Output

```bash
./bin/api-cli run-test test-all-commands/07-simple-working-test.yaml -o json
```

## Conclusion

The `run-test` command successfully simplifies the most common test scenarios, covering approximately 17% of available commands (12 out of 69) but likely 80%+ of typical use cases. The simplified syntax makes test creation much more accessible while maintaining full backward compatibility for advanced users who need the complete command set.
